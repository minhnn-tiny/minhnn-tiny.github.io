bio: |
  I'm passionate about intelligent agents for software engineering — bridging the gap between complex code and AI. I received my B.Eng in Computer Science and Engineering from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT). Currently, I'm a Research Engineer at the SMU School of Computing and Information Systems, under the supervision of Professor Lingxiao JIANG. My work focuses on the critical domain of security, specifically smart contract vulnerability analysis by utilizing Graph Learning and Large Language Models (LLMs). Beyond security, I am exploring the broader AI4SE domain to develop Trustworthy Holistic AI Agents for software engineering challenges, such as bug fixing, code completion/generation, enhanced CI/CDs, and operation monitoring. Balancing academic rigor with entrepreneurial ambition, I am also co-founding MANDO (mandoscan.com) to bring these advanced research solutions to the industry.
